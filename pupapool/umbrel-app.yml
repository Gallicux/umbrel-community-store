description: >-
  A Bitcoin Cash solo mining pool with three fixed‑difficulty ckpool instances
  (250k, 1M, 10M). Designed for home miners and reproducible deployments.

  Features:
    - Three independent ckpool services with fixed difficulty
    - Clean, minimal architecture (no BCH node included)
    - Fully reproducible and auditable setup

  Miner connection:
    - URL: stratum+tcp://<your-host-ip>:9001 (diff 250k)
    - URL: stratum+tcp://<your-host-ip>:9002 (diff 1M)
    - URL: stratum+tcp://<your-host-ip>:9003 (diff 10M)
    - Username: walletAddress.workername
    - Password: anything

  Notes:
    - For maximum compatibility, use a legacy BCH Base58 address (`1...` / `3...`) as the payout address.
    - Many wallets (e.g. Trust Wallet) show CashAddr (`q...` / `p...`). AxeBCH automatically converts CashAddr to legacy format for ckpool compatibility and shows the converted address.
    - Conversion happens locally on your device; AxeBCH does not send your address to any external service.
    - Reference converter (CashAddr <-> legacy): https://bch.info/en/tools/cashaddr
    - Solo mining is extremely unlikely to find blocks without significant hashrate.
    - First sync can be slow on small or busy systems. SSD strongly recommended.


  Components:
    - Bitcoin Cash Node (BCHN) full node (MIT): https://gitlab.com/bitcoin-cash-node/bitcoin-cash-node
    - ckpool (GPLv3) solo pool engine: https://github.com/ctubio/ckpool


  Status:
    - STABLE build: verify payout addresses before mining.
